### about.
I will add jokes written in nearly every programming language I know, and each will print a joke.

### if you...

#### already know the programming language of a certain joke:
- Try to figure it out on your own.
-  **talking**
  - - Ask me any questions you have about the code
  - - Tell me any suitable jokes, *provided* you have a programming language that you think I should write it in.
  - - Report any mistakes or mis-spellings

#### don't know the programming language

I will provide raw text in a *future* commit to this file *or* in a new file.
